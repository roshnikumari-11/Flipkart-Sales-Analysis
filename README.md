# 📊 Flipkart Sales Analysis Using Intermediate SQL Queries

This project simulates real-world e-commerce analytics using a Flipkart-style dataset. I created it using Canva to design the PDF and added actual SQL query screenshots from MySQL Workbench to demonstrate working outputs.

## ✅ Objective

To build a sample Flipkart-style database and analyze customer behavior and product sales using intermediate SQL queries.

## 🧱 Dataset Overview

I asked ChatGPT to generate sample data and tables:

- **customers** – stores customer details  
- **products** – product listings with categories and prices  
- **orders** – tracks orders placed by customers  
- **order_items** – records individual items in each order  

Over 40 realistic mock entries were used to simulate Flipkart transactions.

5. Show the total quantity sold for each category  
6. List the top 3 customers who spent the most in total on orders  
7. Find all products that have never been ordered  
8. Get the average order value per customer  
9. Show the most frequently ordered product based on total quantity sold
